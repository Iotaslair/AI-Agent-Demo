# Overview
This repo is meant to serve as a gentle introduction into Agents.

# Getting Started
1. [Install Opencode's UI](https://opencode.ai/download)
2. [Install Go](https://go.dev/dl/) or whatever programming language you want it to use
3. Launch Opencode in the directory of this Git Repo

# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a super common starting problem for programmers. Here's the problem description:

```
Create a go program that plays the children's game Fizz Buzz up to a hundred. Call the file fizzbuzz.go

Print out `Fizz` if a number is divisble by 3
Print out `Buzz` if a number is divisble by 5
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print out `FizzBuzz`
Print out the number if none of the above conditions are met
```

Copy paste the problem into the text box in Opencode's UI
Once it's done run the code with `go run fizzbuzz.go`

## Iterate with it
Let's say we want the program to replicate two people playing FizzBuzz. We want the program to print out which person says which number. Something like:

Person 1: 1
Person 2: 2
Person 1: Fizz
Person 2: 4
Person 1: Buzz

## Adding tests
Ask it to add unit tests to the code. We should always make sure our code is tested before calling it complete

# Where to go from here
I hope you're starting to get excited because AI Agents can work with stuff much more complicated than a simple example like this. So start to experiment with it!

Here's an idea to get you started

```
Create a terminal-based point-of-sale system written in go with order taking, tax calculation, receipt generation.
```
